git remote add origin url
git push origin main


git branch feature
git checkout feature

git checkout main
git commit -m "Latest commit on main"

from where we have forked that url is known as upstream
origin is my personal

git remote add upstream url
git remote -v

Whatever I have on my branch, please merge it into main project's main branch

I cannot directly push on upstream because the owner is different. But, I have my own origin with me. So, I will push my branch on my origin

git push origin prathamesh

After I created a new pull request, if I add some code to and again commit on this branch. Then it will NOT allow me to create a New Pull request. 
Number of commits will be increased from 1 to 2 on the same pull request
We need to create different branches for new pull requests
NEW pull requests for NEW features



If I delete a commit, I can do it by resetting the head
git reset hash

After that it will contain some previous files, changes, so First bring the files onto the staging area and then stash them. Now, I am in sync with the previous commit

Now, we have to force push the commit because remote contains a commit that is not in my local
git push origin prathamesh -f

Merging the pr will be done by the owner or someone who has write access to that repo


-- HOW TO SYNC ORIGIN WITH UPSTREAM

C:\Users\Admin\Documents\OpenSource\commclassroomOP>git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

C:\Users\Admin\Documents\OpenSource\commclassroomOP>git fetch --all -prune
error: did you mean `--prune` (with two dashes)?

C:\Users\Admin\Documents\OpenSource\commclassroomOP>git fetch --all --prune
Fetching origin
Fetching upstream
From https://github.com/commclassroom/commclassroomOP
 * [new branch]      main       -> upstream/main
 * [new branch]      rahul      -> upstream/rahul
 * [new branch]      rahul-1    -> upstream/rahul-1

C:\Users\Admin\Documents\OpenSource\commclassroomOP>git reset --hard upstream/main
HEAD is now at 49f6657 Merge pull request #26 from R11manish/greeting

C:\Users\Admin\Documents\OpenSource\commclassroomOP>git push origin main
Everything up-to-date

C:\Users\Admin\Documents\OpenSource\commclassroomOP>


SHORTCUT:
git pull upstream main
Now, my local folder's main branch is also in sync with upstream, Let's now sync the ORIGIN with UPSTREAM
git push origin main

C:\Users\Admin\Documents\OpenSource\commclassroomOP>


*** Whenever you are checking out from 1 branch to a new branch, make sure that the prev branch is commited(up to date) Just make a commit before checking out

commits will be merged into the first pick that appears on the top
